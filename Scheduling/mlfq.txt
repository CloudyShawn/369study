==========
Multi-Level Feedback Queue(MLFQ)
==========

- Optimize turnaround time without knowing how long process runs for
- Optimize response time for interactivity
- Learn from the past, predict the future

#####
Basic Rules
#####

- Processes stored on different queues
- Queues are assigned priorities
- Higher priority = quick runtime/IO
- Lower priority = Using CPU for long periods of time
- Higher priority runs first
- Same priority run in Round Robin

- Rule 1: If Priority(A) > Priority(B), A runs and B doesn't
- Rule 2: If Priority(A) = Priority(B), A and B run in RR
- Rule 3: When a job enters system, it's given highest priority
- Rule 4: Once a job uses up schedule quantum at a given level, priority is reduced, regardless of how many times it has given up the CPU.
	- Called STARVATION
- Rule 5: After some time period, move all jobs to topmost queue
- Jobs guaranteed to not starve, will round robin in the top queue
- High priority queues usually get small time slices
- Low priorit queues get larger time slices
