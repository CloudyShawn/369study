Scheduling Metrics:
	Turnaround Time:
		Completion Time - Arrival Time
	Fairness:
		Equal sharing of resources
	Response Time:
		The time from when the job arrives to when it's first scheduled
			First Run Time - Arrival Time

First In, First Out (FIFO) Algorithm
	simple & easy to implement
	first process works until completion, next starts
	PROBLEM:
		If first in takes too long, it delays the small tasks from completing
			assuming all task arrive at same time
		turnaround time could be huge

Shortest Job First (SJF) Algorithm
	Runs shortest job first, then next shortest...
	solves FIFO problems
	PROBLEM:
		small time processes arrive after huge process begins

Preempt:
	To stop a process midway and perform context-switch

Shortest Time-to-Completion First (STCF)
	Preemptive scheduler
		SJF and FIFO are non-preemptive
	Each time job enters system, check all processes for closest completion time and schedules it
	Fixes average turnaround time
	PROBLEM:
		Response Time
			Now all smaller jobs need to finish before a longer job can even start
			Person on computer doesn't want to wait for program they're using to get scheduled when smaller background jobs are
